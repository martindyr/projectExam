A webpage that displays food related posts. These posts are fetched from my backend, in this project i used a headless CMS wordpress.

## Description

This is my first school project ever. It is a cross course projects, that means it is constantly changing as we are learning.
At first the project was to build a website of pure CSS and HTML.
The website we were building was for a company named Rainy Days. They were a clothing company selling mainly rain proof clothing.
After we learned JS and CMS, we had to refature alot of the code we made earlier to match our current knowledge.
We also fetched information from a headless wordpress to display certain information and images about the cothing.

 This is my third school project. It is a project exam to wrap up my second year of part-time front-end developer class.
 The exam was to build a website using HTML, CSS and JS, while fetching most of the information from a headless Wordpress.
 The website displays different food types, what ingridents were used to make the food and a method on how to make it.
 There is a list of posts. The list is fetched from the CMS. By clicking on one of the posts, I pass the ID as a querysting parameter in the URL and fetching spesific infrmation from the CMS on a different page.
