                <h3>Meet Dyrseth</h3>
                <p>I am glad you are interested in my story. The original reason i started this website was to have my
                    own place to display my food. It was my own private coock book. As i got older and my cook book
                    grew, the intrest of sharing my recepies also grew. I forged a new design, created a logo and wolah,
                    a website where everyone can grow their pasonate for cooking like me.</p>
                <p>Hopefully you find something you like.</p>
                <p>Sincerely Dyrseth</p>
